## FAQ

### Are the documents proposals?
Each document lies somewhere between an idea and a proposal.

### Can I contribute?
Of course! Pull requests are welcome and help drive conversation, which is the primary purpose of this repository.

### Do you really expect these ideas to be implemented?
The purpose of publishing the ideas is to have a discussion. Each document, in my mind, holds some merit; whether or not this is significant enough to warrant implementation has yet to be seen.
